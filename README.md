### Identify Enron Fraud

This project involves exploring financial and email data obtained from public records that were released
as part of federal investigations on Enron, one of the largest corporate scandals in US history. The html file
contains the steps that I took to build a person of interest identifier using the data and supervised machine learning methods.

First, I explored the data and handled the outliers. Then, I engineered new features based on existing features. Then, I experimented with different supervised machine learning algorithms for model selection, feature selection, and validation.
